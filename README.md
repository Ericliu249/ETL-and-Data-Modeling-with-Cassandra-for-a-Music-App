## Backgroud

A startup called Sparkify wanted to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team was particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. However, there was no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.
